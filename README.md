# Inclass 3 - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces

## Author



## Description

The purpose of this inclass is to learn about Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces.

We will focus on the following:

Using multiple classes in a program.
Make our code reusable through inheritance.
Show how to abstract common things into parent classes.
Implement interfaces to ensure compatability among new classes.
Why programming in the generic is better than programming in the specific.
